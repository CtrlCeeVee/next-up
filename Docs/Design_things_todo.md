# design brief we need to do
1. Need a dark mode feature, looks cooler (Done ✅)
2. Thinking on the user flow, this looks good but idk something just isnt sitting right:
the users use this to sign into the league. It seems like they have to do too much to get what they want to do everytime: go to the website -> click their league -> scroll to find the league night -> click on the league night -> then only can they register for the league. This is the main thing they use the app for and it shouldnt be the furthest away thing from them. []
3. I believe most of the league night page data is mocked - need to migrate away from this
