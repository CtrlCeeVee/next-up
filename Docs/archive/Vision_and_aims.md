# 📖 Next-Up Vision & Aims

## 1. App Vision

Next-Up exists to make local pickleball leagues **seamless, dynamic, and fun**.
Right now, leagues run on paper/analog systems that cause confusion, downtime, and unbalanced play. Players don’t know when they’re playing next, late arrivals cause chaos, and organizers spend time firefighting instead of enjoying the night.

Next-Up solves this by:

* Dynamically matching available players to available courts.
* Minimizing downtime with automated scheduling.
* Allowing flexible participation (drop in/out, late arrivals).
* Building **personal stats profiles** that players can track over time.

The goal: make a typical league night run like clockwork, while still keeping it **casual, community-driven, and fun**.

## 2. Primary Aims (MVP)

* **League Check-In**: Players arrive and mark themselves present via the app.
* **Dynamic Match Assignment**: The system pairs players into matches and assigns courts, based on who is present.
* **Score Logging**: Teams submit match results, with confirmation required from both sides.
* **Personal Profiles**: Each player has an account with tracked stats (updated after each confirmed match).
* **Admin Controls**: Organizers can override schedules, edit scores, and manage the night’s flow.

## 3. Secondary Aims (Future Roadmap)

* **Tournament Mode**: Seeding, round robin, and knockout formats.
* **Fairness Weighting**: Smarter matchmaking to avoid heavily unbalanced games.
* **Choose Opponents Option**: Players may select their own matches (if agreed).
* **Cross-League Global Profiles**: Track performance across multiple leagues.
* **Enhanced Stats & Dashboards**: Win/loss trends, leaderboards, heatmaps.
* **Live Schedules & Notifications**: Push updates when a new match is ready.
* **Payments & Subscriptions**: Paid access for leagues via SaaS model.

---

## 4. Guiding Principles

* **Mobile-First**: Every player interacts via their own phone; no central screen.
* **Community Vibe**: Friendly, casual-first design that reflects local SA pickleball.
* **Scalable & Replicable**: Designed to onboard new leagues with minimal setup.
* **Admin-Friendly**: Organizers have power to fix issues quickly.
* **Lightweight MVP**: Solve today’s problems before over-engineering tomorrow’s features.

## 5. Differentiation

While other sports management apps exist, they are **too general** and don’t address the real dynamics of South African pickleball leagues.
Next-Up is:

* Localized for SA communities first.
* Designed for **drop-in, casual leagues** (late arrivals, flexible nights).
* Built with **player profiles** and **stats tracking** at its core.
* A product leagues already want — adoption will spread via community word-of-mouth.

---

## 6. Monetization Strategy

* **Phase 1**: Free for early adopters (build traction).
* **Phase 2**: Subscription-based for leagues that want to run on Next-Up.
* **Future Upsells**: Premium analytics, branded dashboards, advanced tournament formats.
* **Sponsorships & Partnerships**: Potentially advertising local sports brands + suggesting going to certain leagues.
