1. Top most valuable (but also most time consuming) thing to do is get the league auto assignment flow working:
    Check-in + Partnership Formation
    Automatic Match Creation → When and after the league night starts, the system continuously creates matches based on available partnerships
    Court Assignment → Limited by available courts, creates priority queue for excess players
    Continuous Play → After finishing a game, players automatically get queued for next match
    Skill-Based Seeding → Uses average points from previous games (starts random, improves over time)

2. Player stats dashboard (probably segment their own dashboard per league, start with it being modular now)
 - implemented but with mock data
3. Design stuff [✅ - DONE!]
- emojis on leaderboard are the medal which have the number (1) not 2 or 3
- Logo is shocking (for anand to solve)
