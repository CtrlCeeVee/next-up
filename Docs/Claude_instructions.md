# Coding instructions for Claude

1. We will always work incrementally, never do too much or more than the scope of the prompt. Since we as developers have extensive coding experience we want full control over the design process of this application.
2. Never try to create various components of the application in one shot. For example if we ever make a page, it will be ONLY that page, and no other pages.
3. When console.logging never use emoji's. 
4. Console logging should only be reserved for errors and not general logging statements unless specifically asked.
5. Never try to run tests on your own - rather tell me the changes you've made and let me test them to ensure everything is working.
