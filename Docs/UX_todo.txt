Im going to compile a BUNCH of changes we need to do here, tick when done:
[DONE ✅] 1. Clicking back on player profile doesnt redirect to the main page but the previous link rather (so if you clicked stats, etc its going to go back to overview)

[DONE ✅] 2. when I start the night if we have less pairings than courts available, that left over courts will only get reassigned when a match finishes and it triggers re-assignment
 - for e.g. 2 courts available, only 2 pairs when night starts. 
 - the 2 pairs get placed on court 1.
 - court 2 still open, new pairs check in but court 2 isn't autofilled when it can be.
 - game on court 1 finished and score gets submitted = triggers auto-assign = both courts get filled. 
 - proper behaviour should be that court 2 was filled when it couldve been as people joined. 

[DONE ✅] 3. The league nights page UI is super cluttered when a lot of people are registered. (Top priority)
 - You can see like 40 people checked in (on mobile only shows 2 at a time)
 - you can see the full queue + whos already played
 - very hard to find your own game when theres a ton of people on. 
 - I think some sort of tab system would work really well here.


[DONE ✅] 4. Finding your partner when there is a TON of people checked in can be a mission, some kind of search or ordering would be optimal
 - I do think this goes with our UI changes for league night as part of the clean up

[] 5. We need, need, need push notifications 
 - currently people are constantly on their phones and dont even know when they get a game without
   needing to constant pay attention. 
 - I think it ties into needing to make it a progressive web app but idk how that all works
 - If we can get it to a point where all they really need to do is check in + get their partner and then just get told when
   their game is on + court number + who they are versing via a push notification it would be huge
   - an extended stretch goal of this would then be that they can submit scores via a widget in the push notification
   - I know some apps have this functionality but I have no clue how it works

[DEFER - needs matchmaking redesign] 6. Knowing who you are playing next
 - A lot of people complained saying it would be more convenient to be able to see who they are playing next
 - Allows them to pre-meet the people and mentally prepare
 - NOTE: Not deterministic with current system - next opponent depends on who finishes current matches and when, 
   plus algorithm avoids repeat pairings. Would need complete matchmaking overhaul to predict reliably.

[DEFER - working as intended] 7. Queueing priorty bug?
 - something strange was happening on the night where people who just finished a game that played later in a pool,
   meaning they were one of the last to play for those who hadn't played - got immediately assigned their next game 
   when their first one finished. 
 - what's good is the system made sure everyone played an equal amount of games, but what we found is that those who got
   a game early, had to wait quite long for their next game. Thus on contrary those who had to wait long for their first game
   waited super short for their next game
 - idk what we can do about this but some sort of priority queueing to try ensure people wait a consist amount of time will
   help with user experience (even tho they all end up playing the same nubmer of games anyway - seems more of a mental thing)
 - NOTE: Adding time-based priority creates player pools (early players only play each other, late players cluster). 
   Current system ensures equal games played for everyone - this is the actual goal. Perception issue, not fairness issue.
   Requires full matchmaking redesign to solve properly.

[DONE ✅] 8. Confirming scores between matches
 - currently whichever team submitted the scores just got their scores saved without any kind of confirmation
 - this results in some issues where people just submitted a score that was incorrect or when they just werent meant to 
   submit a score
 - we need implement a feature where, like the partnership request, when someone submits a score then the other team must 
   confirm before the official score gets confirmed.
 - COMPLETED: Score submission creates pending state, opponent must confirm/dispute before finalizing

[x - did landing page] 9. Caching of information
 - Currently every single time we load the website it does the UI animation of loading the leagues, active players, 
   matches played, etc etc. This is silly.
 - Rather I think either we hardcode or cache the information. Since its a landing page I see no reason to pull any metrics
   from anywhere or which leagues are available. Its easily hardcodable as they dont frequently change and I can just manually
   change it when need be. 
 - this issue extends across the website, not just the league

[] 10. Player profiles
 - We simply havent worked on the player profiles at all but we need to
 - We do have some metrics there but theres no customisation and things like that.
 - Also idk why there is this mock profile generated when we enter a profile which doesnt exist
   - http://localhost:5173/profile/random_random!@ shows an account with user name random_random!@ to display (this account
     does not exist nor has any data)

 BREAKDOWN OF PROFILE WORK:
 
 ✅ WORKING (Real Data):

   [] 5a. Avatar upload functionality
   [] 5b. Charts library integration (replace placeholder divs)
   [] 5c. Achievements system (define achievement criteria)
   [] 5d. Consistency/improvement metrics calculations

 COMPLETED: Phase 1 - Core profile features with real API integration (Dec 9, 2025)

[DONE ✅] 11. Ending the league night
 - We need a way to "end" a league night
 - What I mean is that it normally runs from 6:30-9pm but the app will just keep auto-assigning until people just stop playing
 - Instead as an admin I would want to be able to stop the league night.
 - It shouldnt immediately end everything but rather just stop the auto-assignment from running when a game is finished
 - That way it will allow all the games currently being played to finish and thereafter prevent any more games from occuring.

 [DONE ✅] 12. Admin functionality
  - set number of courts
  - manual games
  - change scores
  - reassign court, etc, etc

[] 13. Redesign tabs
 - tabs functionally are prefect
 - I just currently dont like the segmented card designs 
 - No idea what I want but not that.

[] 14. Time gated score confirmation
 - score should be auto confirmed after a certain amount of time has passed.
 - prevents users just leaving and not confirming a score resulting in stuck courts
 
[DONE ✅] 15. Designing this to be more like an app
 - currently the front page operates very much like a website
 - has the cover page giving info (landing page of a website)
 - I want to start pivoting more towards a app feel for when we make it a PWA
 - The way I want to do it is as follows:
   - Keep it the exact same landing page when the user is not signed in.
   - When signed in:
     - new interface thats more app style (playtonic)
     - new clubs / you clubs / almost like a landing dashboard of some kind?


[] 16. More helpful error messages
  - currently if you are disconnected (i.e. i stop the server) but still use the app the and get connectivity issues it doesnt say
  - for example if I use the app on no connection and click my profile it just says profile not found instead of just saying you internet is down:
    - heres the error message: API Error for /api/leagues: TypeError: Failed to fetch
    - displayed error message: profile not found


[DONE ✅] 17. Bottom hotbar persistence
  - part of 15 which we've partially done
  - on the new dashboard twe have a bottom hotbar
  - when we click "tonight" or any of the browse league features we lose it
  - it makes the bottom of the screen feel empty but also just makes it harder to navigate
