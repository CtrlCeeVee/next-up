1. EMERGENCY TODO: 
Currently some people show up to the night without a phone then it gets super complicated as they cant really play then.

We have no way of placing even just their name into the pool of players.

Furthermore some kids come play in the league and their parents have a phone but they dont - same issue.

We have 2 thoughts of solving this right now, I think we actually implement both.

1. Admins can create temp accounts (or permanent) for people without a phone and check them in. Then just facilitate for them in some sense. ✅ COMPLETE
2. Parents can have "dependants" under their account. I.e. I can check in for my child. 
 - in some sense this could also work for friends who want to check in their friends who dont have phones.

Either way we want both:
1. Admins can check in for others ✅ COMPLETE
2. Friends can check in for friends (Future work)

This way people can still be a part of the league without even using a phone!

My only thing I need to think through is: 
How would their stats work? Would we just create an account for them to store their stats?

Then they can still access their account at anytime. Or rather setup their account at anytime but we still store their stats. ✅ SOLVED - Full accounts created with stats

(Finished: Admin can check in/out players, partner them up/remove partnerships, and create temporary accounts for players without phones)
