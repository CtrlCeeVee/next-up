NEXT-UP DEVELOPMENT LOG
======================

Week 1: Foundation Setup ✅
Luke-to-do:
 ✅ generate final full MVP (for AI use)
 ✅ repo setup
 - AWS setup
 ✅ domain 

Anand-to-do:
 ✅ figure out tech stack
   ✅ front + backend + DB (with AWS in mind)
   ✅ generate repo structure
     ✅ (client/ … server/ … )
     ✅ local setup (npm install … )

COMPLETED:
✅ Created comprehensive documentation (MVP.md, User_stories.md, Vision_and_aims.md)
✅ Set up React + TypeScript + Tailwind frontend with Vite
✅ Created league selection landing page for players
✅ Set up Express.js backend with CORS and basic endpoints
✅ Created mock API endpoints matching frontend data
✅ Set up development environment with hot reload
✅ Created setup scripts for easy developer onboarding

TECH STACK FINALIZED:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (Vite build)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage)
- Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Render (backend)
- Domain: next-up.co.za
- Future: Migration to AWS (Amplify + ECS + RDS + Cognito)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Basic app structure working
- Frontend and backend communicating
- Mock data flowing through system
- Development environment fully functional

NEXT PRIORITIES:
1. Connect client to fetch data from server API (instead of mock data)
2. Set up Supabase project and basic schema
3. Implement user authentication flow
4. Create league night check-in page
5. Build player matching algorithm

ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
- Mobile-first design approach
- RESTful API design
- Component-based React architecture
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind for consistent styling
- Incremental development approach
